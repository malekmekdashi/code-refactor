The idea of this assignment is to apply html5 semantic elements by replacing the <div> elements in their places. The html5 elements include, main, section, aside, header, footer, body, and more. This allows the code to look much smoother by placing the code into different sections and allowing to navigate much smoother around. alongside these changes, i also added some alt attributes to the images so when you hover over them, a little description will show. I also added a title element so when you look at the tab on top of the browser, it will show the title of the website and the contents of the page. The heading attributes also fall in sequential order.
